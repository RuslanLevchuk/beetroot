TO MAKE EDITING EASIER AND COLLABORATIVE

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 4.0.0
----------------------------------------------

- Esp plugin has been removed.

- All rules, functions, command line options and modules that contain
  "whitelist" or "blacklist" have been renamed to contain more racially
  neutral "welcomelist" and "blocklist" terms.  Old names will continue work
  as backwards compatibility atleast until 4.1 release.  If you have local
  settings like scores or metas referring to old rule names, these should be
  changed, after which "enable_compat welcomelist_blocklist" can be added in
  init.pre.  See: https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WelcomelistBlocklist
  (Bug 7826)

- Setting normalize_charset is now enabled by default.  Note that rules
  should not expect specific non-UTF8 or UTF8 encoding in body.  Matching is
  done against raw bytes, which may vary depending on normalize_charset
  setting and whether decoding to UTF8 was successful.
  See: https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WritingRulesAdvanced

- IDN (Internationalized domain name) support, requires Net::LibIDN2 or
  Net::LibIDN module.  New Util::idn_to_ascii() function.  (Bug 7215)

- Meta rules no longer use priority values, they are evaluated dynamically
  when the rules they depend on are finished.  (Bug 7735)

- API: New $pms->rule_ready() function. Any asynchronous eval-function must
  now return undef (instead of 0 or 1), if rule result is not ready when
  exiting the function.  $pms->rule_ready($rulename) or $pms->got_hit(...)
  must be called when the result has arrived.  If these are not used, it can
  break depending meta rule evaluation.

- Improved internal header address (From/To/Cc) parser, now also handles
  multiple addresses.  Optional support for external Email::Address::XS
  parser, which can handle nested comments and other oddities.

- Header :addr :name modifiers now returns all addresses.  :first :last
  select only first (topmost) or last header to process, when there are
  multiple headers with the same name (:addr and :name may still return
  multiple values from a single header).

- API: $pms->get() can and should now be called in list context.  Scalar
  context continues to return multiple values newline separated, but this
  should be considered deprecated.

- New ExtractText plugin that extracts text from documents or images and feed it
  into SpamAssassin

- New --forcemirror option added to sa-update to force rules download from a
  specific mirror

- New Esp plugin that checks spam coming from some Esp providers

- New nolog tflag added to hide info coming from rules in SpamAssassin reports

- All log output (stderr, file, syslog) is now escaped properly,
  \r \n \t \\, and control chars, DEL, UTF-8 sequences as \x{XX}.
  Whitespace is not normalized anymore like in versions <4.0.

- API: Logger::add() has new optional 'escape' parameter.
  New Logger::escape_str() function.

- API: New $pms->add_uri_detail_list() function.  Also new uri_detail_list
  types: unlinked, schemeless

- Util::split_domain, trim_domain, is_domain_valid functions have new
  optional argument ($is_ascii)

- Header names support new :host :domain :ip :revip modifiers

- AskDNS: tag HEADER(hdrname) supported to query any header content
  similarly to header rules

- HashCash module and support has been removed completely, as it has been
  long since deprecated

- URILocalBL: uri_block_cc/uri_block_cont support negation (Bug 7528)

- URILocalBL: IPv6 lookups for hosts, if supported by used database

- DNS (or other async) lookups are now only launched when priority -100 is
  reached. This allows shortcircuiting at lower priority without sending
  unneeded DNS queries. (Bug 5930)

- API: New plugin callback method check_dnsbl (to launch network lookups at
  priority -100), check_post_dnsbl (to harvest own network lookups)

- API: New plugin callback method check_cleanup (for cleaning up things..)

- FreeMail: new options freemail_import_welcomelist_auth,
  freemail_import_def_welcomelist_auth added (Bug 6451)

- New internal Mail::SpamAssassin::GeoDB module that provides unified interface to
  modules MaxMind::DB::Reader (GeoIP2), Geo::IP, IP::Country::DB_File, IP::Country::Fast.
  Utilized by RelayCountry and URILocalBL. Settings geodb_module, geodb_options,
  geodb_search_path. Deprecated settings country_db_type, country_db_path,
  uri_country_db_path, uri_country_db_isp_path still work but print a warning to
  migrate to geodb_module/options.

- Razor2 razor_fork option added.  It will fork separate Razor2 process and
  read in the results later asynchronously, increasing throughput.  When
  this is used, rule priorities are automatically adjusted to -100.

- DCC check is now done asynchronously if using dccifd, improving throughput.
  With dccifd, rule priorities are automatically adjusted to -100. 
  Commercial reputation rules can be ignored with use_dcc_rep 0, to save few
  CPU cycles.

- Pyzor pyzor_fork option added. It will fork separate Pyzor process and
  read in the results later asynchronously, increasing throughput. When
  this is used, rule priorities are automatically adjusted to -100. Renamed
  pyzor_max setting to pyzor_count_min.  Added pyzor_welcomelist_min and
  pyzor_welcomelist_factor setting.  Also try to ignore "empty body" FPs.

- API: deprecated $pms->register_async_rule_start() and
  $pms->register_async_rule_finish() calls (they can be left in code for
  backwards compatibility).  Plugins should only use
  $pms->bgsend_and_start_lookup() which handles required things
  automatically (direct calls to bgsend or start_lookup should not be used). 
  $pms->bgsend_and_start_lookup() should always contain $ent->{rulename} for
  correct meta dependency handling.  Deprecated also start_lookup,
  get_lookup, lookup_ns, harvest_until_rule_completes, is_rule_complete.

- SPF: Mail::SPF is now only supported.  Mail::SPF::Query use is deprecated,
  along with settings do_not_use_mail_spf, do_not_use_mail_spf_query.  SPF
  lookups are not done asyncronously, for best throughput one should use MTA
  filter (pypolicyd-spf / spf-engine etc), from which generated Received-SPF
  header can be parsed by SpamAssassin.

- "ALL" pseudo-header now returns decoded headers, so it's usage is consistent
  with single header matching (:raw returns undecoded and folded like before).

- New dns_block_rule option handles blocked DNSBLs (Bug 6728)

- New AuthRes module to process Authentication-Results headers (unfinished,
  Bug 6918)

- ASN: Support GeoDB for ASN lookups (asn_use_geodb, asn_prefer_geodb,
  asn_use_dns).

- ASN: Default sa-update ruleset doesn't make ASN lookups or header adds
  anymore.  Configure desired methods (asn_use_geodb / asn_use_dns) and
  add_header clauses manually, as described in plugin documentation.  Usage
  of asn_use_geodb without DNS is recommended, unless ASNCIDR is needed.  Do
  not use rules that check metadata X-ASN header! Only the new eval function
  described in plugin manual works reliably: check_asn().

- sa-update: New --score-multiplier, --score-limit options

- New dns_options nov4, nov6 (must set nov6 if resolver is filtering AAAA
  replies).

- API: Added Message::get_pristine_body_digest(), Message::get_msgid(),
  Message::generate_msgid() functions, removed deprecated private
  Plugin::Bayes::get_msgid() function.

- Bayes and TxRep seen (Message-ID tracking) hashing method changed.
  No actions are required. If re-learning some old messages, they might
  be learned twice. Old IDs should expire automatically.

- report_charset defaults now to UTF-8

- Meta rules inherit net tflag from it's dependencies (Bug 7735)

- BodyEval: plaintext_body_sig_ratio: eval rules for the (first text/plain
  MIME part's) body and signature lengths and ratio

- API: Now supports multiple calls of $pms->test_log() for rules.  Add
  $pms->check_cleanup() to finalize tags/reports etc.  Deprecate internal
  $pms->{test_log_msgs}, rename to $pms->{test_logs}.  Deprecate
  $pms->clear_test_state(), not needed anymore.  $pms->test_log() accepts
  $rulename as second argument.

- URIDNSBL: urirhsbl/urirhssub rules support "notrim" tflag, which
  forces querying the full hostname, instead of trimmed domain.  This works
  better if the specific uribl supports this mode. (Bug 7835)

- Removed deprecated --auth-ident and --ident-timeout options from spamd

- MIMEHeader: support matching ALL header, tflags range, tflags concat

- Autolearn: add new tflags autolearn_header/autolearn_body. These can
  force a rule to count as header or body points accordingly. (Bug 7907)

- SSL client certificate support for spamc/spamd.  New spamc options
  --ssl-cert, --ssl-key, --ssl-ca-file, --ssl-ca-path.  New spamd options
  --ssl-verify, --ssl-ca-file, --ssl-ca-path (Bug 7267)

- ArchiveIterator now uncompresses automatically all gzip, bzip2, xz, lz4,
  lzip and lzo-compressed files (Bug 7598).  These apply to spamassassin
  and sa-learn commands also.

- New DMARC policy check plugin

- New project maintained DecodeShortURLs plugin.  Note that it might not be
  directly compatible with rules from the old third party plugin.  See
  documentation for configuration and rule format.

- Installing module Net::CIDR::Lite allows to use dash separated IP range
  format (e.g. 192.168.1.1-192.168.255.255) for NetSet tables
  (internal_networks, trusted_networks, msa_networks, uri_local_cidr).

- HashBL: New functions check_hashbl_tag, check_hashbl_attachments.
  New sha256 option.

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.5
----------------------------------------------

- Spamassassin test suite can now run against the installed
  SpamAssassin files (rather than those in the source directory)

- unwelcomelist_auth now also removes def_welcomelist_auth entries

- SPF: add unwelcomelist_from_spf to remove both welcomelist_from_spf and
  def_welcomelist_from_spf entries

- Default SQL schema for userpref.value changed from varchar(100) to
  varchar(255), no need to modify unless you hit the limit. (Bug 7803)

- URIDetail can now match full hostname with "host" key

- BodyEval: plaintext_body_sig_ratio: eval rules for the (first text/plain
  MIME part's) body and signature lengths and ratio

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.4
----------------------------------------------

- FromNameSpoof: fns_extrachars parameter default value has been increased to 50

- nosubject and maxhits tflags now work correctly with sa-compile

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.3
----------------------------------------------

- New subjprefix keyword added, this can be used to add a prefix to
  email Subject if the original email matches a particular rule

- New Util::is_fqdn_valid() function to validate hostname (DNS name) format
  (Bug 7736).  To check if a name contains valid TLD, it's still needed to
  additionally use RegistryBoundaries::is_domain_valid()

- New OLEVBMacro plugin to detect OLE Macro inside documents attached to emails,
  this plugin requires Archive::Zip and IO::String Perl modules to work.

- Due to the dangerous nature of sa-update --allowplugins option, it
  now prints a warning that --reallyallowplugins is required to use it.
  This is to make sure all the legacy installations and wiki guides etc
  still using it needlessly get fixed.

- TxRep and Awl plugins has been modified to be compatible 
  with latest Postgresql versions.
  You should upgrade your sql database running the following command:
  MySQL:
  "ALTER TABLE `txrep` CHANGE `count` `msgcount` INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';"
  "ALTER TABLE `awl` CHANGE `count` `msgcount` INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';"
  "ALTER TABLE `awl` ADD last_hit timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;"
  PostgreSQL:
  "ALTER TABLE txrep RENAME COLUMN count TO msgcount;"
  "ALTER TABLE awl RENAME COLUMN count TO msgcount;"
  "ALTER TABLE awl ADD last_hit timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;"

- body_part_scan_size 50000, rawbody_part_scan_size 500000 defaults added (Bug 6582)
  These enable safer and faster scanning of large emails.

- ALL pseudo-header now returns decoded headers, so it's usage is consistent
  with single header matching (:raw returns undecoded and folded like before).

- RegistryBoundaries did not load 20_aux_tlds.cf properly in older versions. 
  Old hardcoded list is now removed and RB will print "no tlds defined, need
  to run sa-update" unless it can find list from config files.

- Deprecated functions: Parser::is_delimited_regexp_valid(),
  Parser::is_regexp_valid(), Util::regexp_remove_delimiters(),
  Util::make_qr().  These all are combined into new Util::compile_regexp().

- DNSEval: add check_rbl_headers to check specific headers in rbl

- DNSEval: add check_rbl_ns_from to check against an rbl for dns servers

- HashBL: Add check_hashbl_bodyre, check_hashbl_emails, check_hashbl_uris,
  hashbl_ignore

- ASN: Support IPv6 with asn_lookup_ipv6 (Bug 7211)

- sa-update: New option --httputil to force used download utility

- Add rules_matching() expression to meta rules

- Add tflags domains_only/ips_only to DNSEval.pm functions

- RelayCountry: Added new metadata: X-Spam-Countries-External (_RELAYCOUNTRYEXT_),
  X-Spam-Countries-Auth (_RELAYCOUNTRYAUTH_), X-Spam-Countries-All (_RELAYCOUNTRYALL_)

- New tflag "nosubject" for 'body' rules, to stop matching the Subject
  header which is part of the body text.

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.2
----------------------------------------------

- We now support SHA-512 and SHA-256 signatures for our rules updates.

- We may stop producing SHA-1 signatures in the near future so upgrading
to 3.4.2 is important.  sa-update no longer uses these signatures.

See https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7614

New plugins
-----------

There are four new plugins added with this release:

  Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::HashBL

The HashBL plugin is the interface to The Email Blocklist (EBL).
The EBL is intended to filter spam that is sent from IP addresses 
and domains that cannot be blocked without causing significant 
numbers of false positives.

  Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::ResourceLimits

This plugin leverages BSD::Resource to assure your spamd child processes
do not exceed specified CPU or memory limit. If this happens, the child
process will die. See the BSD::Resource for more details.

  Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::FromNameSpoof

This plugin allows for detection of the From:name field being used to mislead 
recipients into thinking an email is from another address.  The man page 
includes examples and we expect to put test rules for this plugin into 
rulesrc soon!

  Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Phishing

This plugin finds uris used in phishing campaigns detected by
OpenPhish (https://openphish.com) or PhishTank (https://phishtank.com) feeds.

These plugins are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment
the loadplugin configuration options in file v342.pre, or add it to
some local .pre file such as local.pre .

Notable changes
---------------

For security reasons SSLv3 support has been removed from spamc(1).

GeoIP2 support has been added to RelayCountry and URILocalBL plugins due
to GeoIP legacy api deprecations.

New configuration options
-------------------------

A new template tag _DKIMSELECTOR_ that maps to the DKIM selector (the 's' tag) 
from valid signatures has been added.

A 'uri_block_cont' option to URILocalBL plugin to score uris per continent has been added.
Possible continent codes are:
af, as, eu, na, oc, sa for Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, 
Oceania and South America.

The 'country_db_type' and 'country_db_path' options has been added to be able 
to choose in RelayCountry plugin between GeoIP legacy 
(discontinued from 04/01/2018), GeoIP2, IP::Country::Fast 
and IP::Country::DB_File.
GeoIP legacy is still the default option but it will be deprecated 
in future releases.

A config option 'uri_country_db_path' has been added to be able to choose 
in URILocalBL plugin between GeoIP legacy and new GeoIP2 api.

A config option 'resource_limit_cpu' (default: 0 or no limit) has been added
to configure how many cpu cycles are allowed on a child process before it dies.

A config option 'resource_limit_mem' (default: 0 or no limit) has been added
to configure the maximum number of bytes of memory allowed both for 
(virtual) address space bytes and resident set size.

A new config option 'report_wrap_width' (default: 70) has been added
to set the wrap width for description lines in the X-Spam-Report header.

Notable Internal changes
------------------------

SpamAssassin can cope with new Net::DNS module versions.

The "bytes" pragma has been remove from both core modules and plugins for
better utf-8 compatibility, there has been also some other utf-8 related fixes.

The spamc(1) client can now be build against OpenSSL 1.1.0.

The test framework has been switched to Test::More module.

Other updates
-------------

A list of top-level domains in registrar boundaries was updated.


Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.1
----------------------------------------------

- The TxRep plugin is now included and disabled by default for new installs.
  To replace an existing AWL configuration with TxRep, follow the steps below:
  - Disable AWL
  - Enable TxRep
  - Set txrep_factor equal to your previous AWL factor
  - Set use_txrep to 1

  For more detailed information and more configuration options, consult the
  documentation in Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::TxRep.

- The $VALID_TLDS_RE global in registrar boundaries is deprecated but kept for 
  third-party plugin compatibility.  It will become increasingly out of date
  and may be removed in a future release. 

  See lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/FreeMail.pm for an example of the new way
  to obtain a valid list of TLDs, i.e. 

    $self->{main}->{registryboundaries}->{valid_tlds_re} 

- Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries is being replaced by 
  Mail::SpamAssassin::RegistryBoundaries so that new TLDs can be updated via 
  20_aux_tlds.cf delivered via sa-update.

  ***3rd Party Plugin Authors, Please Note***
  
  The following functions will be removed in the next release after 3.4.1 
  excepting any emergency break/fix releases immediately after 3.4.1:
  
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::is_domain_valid 
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::trim_domain
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::split_domain 
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::uri_to_domain 
  
  And the following variables will also be removed:
  
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::US_STATES
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::THREE_LEVEL_DOMAINS
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::TWO_LEVEL_DOMAINS
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::VALID_TLDS_RE
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries::VALID_TLDS
  
  
  This change should only affect 3rd party plugin authors who will need to 
  update their code to utilize Mail::SpamAssassin::RegistryBoundaries 
  instead of the functions and variables in 
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::RegistrarBoundaries and the function 
  Mail::SpamAssassin::Util::uri_to_domain which are deprecated and will be 
  removed.

  For example, the $VALID_TLDS_RE global in registrar boundaries is 
  deprecated but kept for third-party plugin compatibility.  It will become 
  increasingly out of date and may be removed in a future release.

  See lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/FreeMail.pm for an example of the new way
  to obtain a valid list of TLDs, i.e.

    $self->{main}->{registryboundaries}->{valid_tlds_re}

- It is now recommended that users uncomment "normalize_charset 1" in
  local.cf. It will break rules that depend on messages being in non-UTF8
  encodings, but going forward this will enable more robust unicode rules and
  will eventually become the default.



Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.4.0
----------------------------------------------

- When Bayes classification is in use and messages are 'learned' as spam
  or ham and stored in a database, the Bayes plugin generates internal
  message IDs of learned messages and stores them in a 'seen' database to
  avoid re-learning duplicates and accidental un-learning messages that
  were not previously learned. With changes in bug 5185, the calculation
  of message IDs in a bayes 'seen' database has changed, so new code can
  no longer associate new messages with those learned before the change.

- Note that this change does not affect recognition of old tokens and the
  classification algorithm, only duplicate detection and unlearning of old
  messages is affected.

- Because of this change, if you use Bayes and you are upgrading from a
  version prior to 3.4.0, you may consider wiping your Bayes database
  and starting fresh.

- There is a new optional dependency on Net::Patricia to speed up lookups
  on internal_networks, trusted_networks or msa_networks when these lists
  contain a larger number of entries. Consider installing this module to
  speed up classification.

- The minimal required version of NetAddr::IP was bumped to 4.010

- In addition to existing backends, the 3.4.0 introduces support for keeping
  a Bayes database on a Redis server, either running locally, or accessed
  over network. Similar to SQL backends, the database may be concurrently
  used by several hosts running SpamAssassin.

- For more detail on these and other changes, please see the Announcement
  file at:
   http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/branches/3.4/build/announcements/3.4.0.txt

Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.3.0
-----------------------------------------------

- Rules are no longer included with SpamAssassin "out of the box".  You will
  need to immediately run "sa-update", or download the additional rules .tgz
  package and run "sa-update --install" with it, to get a ruleset.

- The BETA label has been taken off of the SpamAssassin SQL support.  Please
  be aware that occasional changes may still be made to this area of the
  code.  You should be sure to read this upgrade document each time you
  install a new version to determine if any SQL updates need to be made to
  your local installation.

- The DKIM plugin is now enabled by default for new installs, if the perl
  module Mail::DKIM is installed.  However, installation of SpamAssassin
  will not overwrite existing .pre configuration files, so to use DKIM when
  upgrading from a previous release that did not use DKIM, a directive:

    loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DKIM

  will need to be uncommented in file "v312.pre", or added to some
  other .pre file, such as local.pre.


Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.2.0
-----------------------------------------------

- The "127/8" network, including 127.0.0.1, is now always implicitly part of
  "trusted_networks" and "internal_networks".  It's impossible to remove these
  from the trusted/internal sets, since if you cannot trust the host where
  SpamAssassin is running, you cannot trust SpamAssassin itself.  If you
  previously had "trusted_networks" and "internal_networks" lines listing those
  hosts, you should now remove them, otherwise a minor (non-lint-error) warning
  will be output.

- For ISPs -- version 3.2.0 now includes a new way to specify Mail Submission
  Agents, relay hosts which accept mail from your own users and authenticates
  them appropriately.  See the Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf manual page for the
  "msa_networks" setting.


Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.1.0
-----------------------------------------------

- A significant amount of core functionality has been moved into
  plugins.  These include, AWL (auto-welcomelist), DCC, Pyzor, Razor2,
  SpamCop reporting and TextCat.  For information on configuring these
  plugins please refer to their individual documentation:
  perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::* (ie AWL, DCC, etc)

- There are now multiple files read to enable plugins in the
  /etc/mail/spamassassin directory; previously only one, "init.pre" was
  read.  Now both "init.pre", "v310.pre", and any other files ending
  in ".pre" will be read.  As future releases are made, new plugins
  will be added to new files named according to the release they're
  added in.

- Due to license restrictions the DCC and Razor2 plugins are disabled
  by default.  We encourage you to read the appropriate license
  yourself and decide if you are able to re-enable the plugins for
  your site.

- The use_auto_welcomelist config option has been moved to a user config
  option, this allows individual users to turn on or off welcomelisting
  regardless of what is set in the system config.  If you would like to
  disable AWL (auto-welcomelist) on a site-wide basis, then you can comment
  out the plugin in "v310.pre".

- The bayes_auto_learn_threshold_* config options for bayes have moved
  to a plugin.  In general the default should work just fine however
  if you are interested in changing these values you should see:
  perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::AutoLearnThreshold

- The AWL support for NDBM_File databases has been dropped, due to a
  bug in that package which renders it useless (bug 4353).  It appears
  that SDBM_File, the package which will be used instead, is fully
  compatible with NDBM however, so this should be unnoticeable.

- The prefork algorithm for spamd has been changed.  In this version spamd
  will attempt to keep a small number of "hot" child processes as busy as
  possible, and keep any others as idle as possible, using something
  similar to the Apache httpd server scaling algorithm. This reduces
  memory usage and swapping. You can use the --round-robin switch for
  spamd to disable this scaling algorithm, and the behaviour seen in the
  3.0.x versions will be used instead, where all processes receive an
  equal load and no scaling takes place.

- As of 3.1.0, in addition to the generic BayesSQL support (via
  Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::SQL) usable by multiple database
  drivers there is now specific support for MySQL 4.1+ and
  PostgreSQL.  This support is based on non-standard features present
  in both database servers that allow for various performance boosts.

  If you were using the previous BayesSQL support with MySQL, and
  already have MySQL 4.1+ installed you can begin using the new module
  immediately by replacing the bayes_store_module line in your
  configuration with:  Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::MySQL

  We do however recommend that you switch your MySQL tables over to
  InnoDB for better data integrity and multi user support.  You can
  most often do this via a simple ALTER TABLE command, refer to the
  MySQL documentation for more information.

  If you were previously using PostgreSQL for your bayes database then
  we STRONGLY recommend switching to the PostgreSQL specific backend:
  Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::PgSQL
  To switch to this backend you should first run sa-learn --backup to
  make a backup of your existing data and then drop and recreate the
  database following the instructions in sql/README.bayes.  Then you
  can restore the database with sa-learn --restore.  If you have
  multiple users then you will have to run --backup and --restore for
  each user to fully restore the database.

- See http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UpgradeTo310 for a
  supplementary list of upgrade notes.  It will be updated with any
  upgrade notes not captured in this document.

- Finally, this document is likely not complete.  Other configuration
  options/arguments may have changed from older versions, etc.  It would
  be good to double-check any custom configuration options to make sure
  they're still valid.  This could be as simple as running "spamassassin
  --lint", or more complex, as required by the environment.


Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.0.x
----------------------------------------------

- The SpamAssassin 2.6x release series was the last set of releases to
  officially support perl versions earlier than perl 5.6.1.  If you are
  using an earlier version of perl, you will need to upgrade before you
  can use the 3.0.0 version of SpamAssassin.  You will also want to make
  sure that you have the appropriate versions of required and optional
  modules as they may have changed from old versions.  The INSTALL
  document has the modules and version requirements listed.

- See http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UpgradeTo300 for a
  supplementary list of upgrade notes.  It will be updated with any
  upgrade notes not captured in this document.

- SpamAssassin 3.0.0 has a significantly different API (Application Program
  Interface) from the 2.x series of code.  This means that if you use
  SpamAssassin through a third-party utility (milter, etc,) you need to make
  sure you have an updated version which supports 3.0.0.  See
  http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UpgradeTo300 for information about
  third-party software.

- The --auto-welcomelist, --welcomelist and -a options for "spamd" and
  "spamassassin" to turn on the auto-welcomelist have been removed and
  replaced by the "use_auto_welcomelist" configuration option which is
  also now turned on by default.

- The --virtual-config switch for spamd had to be dropped, due to licensing
  issues.  It is replaced by the --virtual-config-dir switch.

- The "rewrite_subject" and "subject_tag" configuration options were
  deprecated and are now removed. Instead, using "rewrite_header Subject
  [your desired setting]".  e.g.

    rewrite_subject 1
    subject_tag ****SPAM(_SCORE_)****

  becomes

    rewrite_header Subject ****SPAM(_SCORE_)****

- The "sa-learn --rebuild" command has been deprecated; please use
  "sa-learn --sync" instead.  The --rebuild option will remain temporarily
  for backward compatibility.

- The Bayesian storage modules have been completely re-written and now
  include Berkeley DB (DBM) storage as well as SQL based storage (see
  sql/README.bayes for more information).  In addition, a new format
  has been introduced for the bayes database that stores tokens in fixed
  length hashes (Bayes v3).  All DBM databases should be automatically
  converted to this new format the first time they are opened for write.
  You can manually perform the upgrade by running "sa-learn --sync"
  from the command line.

  Due to the database format change, you will want to do something like
  this when upgrading:

  - stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
    during the upgrade)
  - run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip
    this step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is
    upgraded.
  - upgrade SA to 3.0.0
  - run "sa-learn --sync", which will cause the db format to be upgraded.
    if you want to see what is going on, you can add the "-D" option.
  - test the new database by running some sample mails through
    SpamAssassin, and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure
    the data looks valid.
  - start running spamassassin/spamd again

  If, instead of uprading your Bayes database, you want to wipe it and
  start fresh, you can run "sa-learn --clear" to safely remove your
  Bayes database files.  If the --clear command issues an error then
  you can simply delete the Bayes database files ("bayes_*") while SA
  is not running; SpamAssassin will recreate them in the current
  format when it runs.

- "spamd" now has a default max-children setting of 5; no more than 5
  child scanner processes will be run in parallel.  Previously, there was
  no default limit unless you specified the "-m" switch when starting
  spamd.

- If you are using a UNIX machine with all database files on local disks,
  and no sharing of those databases across NFS filesystems, you can use a
  more efficient, but non-NFS-safe, locking mechanism.   Do this by adding
  the line "lock_method flock" to the /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
  file. This is strongly recommended if you're not using NFS, as it is
  much faster than the NFS-safe locker.

- Please note that the use of the following commandline parameters for
  spamassassin and spamd have been deprecated and may be removed in
  upcoming versions of SpamAssassin.  Please discontinue usage of these
  options:

    in the 2.6x series:		--add-from, --pipe, -F, --stop-at-threshold,
    				-S, -P (spamassassin only)
    in the 3.0.x series:	--auto-whitelist, -a, --whitelist-factory, -M,
    				--warning-from, -w, --log-to-mbox, -l

- user_scores_sql_table is no longer supported.  If you need to use a table
  name, other than the default, create a custom query using the
  user_scores_sql_custom_query config option.

- SpamAssassin runs in "taint mode" by default for improved security.
  Certain third-party modules may be incompatible with taint mode.

- 2.6x deprecated the use of the "check_bayes_db" script, and it
  has been removed in 3.0.0.  Please see the sa-learn man/pod
  documentation for more info.

- Finally, this document is likely not complete.  Other configuration
  options/arguments may have changed from older versions, etc.  It would
  be good to double-check any custom configuration options to make sure
  they're still valid.  This could be as simple as running "spamassassin
  --lint", or more complex, as required by the environment.

  An example: "require_version <version>" hasn't changed itself, but the
  internal version representation is now "x.yyyzzz" instead of "x.yz"
  which could cause issues if "require_version 3.00" is expected to work
  (it won't, it needs to be "require_version 3.000000").


Note for Users Upgrading from SpamAssassin 2.5x
-----------------------------------------------

- Due to major reliability shortcomings in the database support libraries
  other than DB_File, we now require that the DB_File module be installed
  to use SpamAssassin's Bayes rules.

  SpamAssassin will still work without DB_File installed, but the Bayes
  support will be disabled.

  If you install DB_File and wish to import old Bayes database data, each
  user with a Bayes db should run "sa-learn --import" to copy old entries
  from the other formats into a new DB_File file.

  Due to the database library change, and the change to the database
  format itself, you will want to do something like this when upgrading:

  - stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
    during the upgrade)
  - run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip
    this step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is
    upgraded.
  - install DB_File module if necessary
  - upgrade SA to 3.0.0
  - if you were using another database module previously, run "sa-learn
    --import" to migrate the data into new DB_File files
  - run "sa-learn --sync", which will cause the db format to be upgraded.
    if you want to see what is going on, you can add the "-D" option.
  - test the new database by running some sample mails through
    SpamAssassin, and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure
    the data looks valid.
  - start running spamassassin/spamd again

  Obviously the steps will be different depending on your environment, but
  you get the idea. :)


Note For Users Upgrading From SpamAssassin 2.3x or 2.4x
-------------------------------------------------------

- SpamAssassin no longer includes code to handle local mail delivery, as
  it was not reliable enough, compared to procmail.  So now, if you relied
  on spamassassin to write the mail into your mail folder, you'll have to
  change your setup to use procmail as detailed below.  If you used
  spamassassin to filter your mail and then something else wrote it into a
  folder for you, then you should be fine.

- Support for versions of the optional Mail::Audit module is no longer
  included.

- The default mode of tagging (which used to be ***SPAM*** in the subject
  line) no longer takes place.  Instead the message is rewritten. If an
  incoming message is tagged as spam, instead of modifying the original
  message, SpamAssassin will create a new report message and attach the
  original message as a message/rfc822 MIME part (ensuring the original
  message is completely preserved and easier to recover).  If you do not
  want to modify the body of incoming spam, use the "report_safe" option.
  The "report_header" and "defang_mime" options have been removed as a
  result.
